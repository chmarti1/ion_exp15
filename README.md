# ION Experiment 15

Stagnation pressure arrays measured under the preheat flame with various standoffs, flow rates, and fuel/oxygen ratios.  Pressures are measured in a .04" diameter plain orifice drilled in a water cooled copper block.  The torch is scanned back-and-forth in 20mm long lines separated by 2mm at a rate of 120mm/min.  The Pressure is measured by a 1inWC differential pressure sensor.  10VDC = 1inWC
